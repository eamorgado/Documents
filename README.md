# Documents
A repo for personal academic documents such as reports, artcles and maybe even study notes. As of this moment, they mostly contain reports for subjects.
In the future I plan on adding some of my transcribed notes, you may notice that the written language is portuguese as that is my native tonge and the language required for the documents.
I cannot assure you that future documents won't be in that language.
