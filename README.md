# Documents
A repo for personal academic documents such as reports, articles and maybe even study notes. As of this moment, they mostly contain reports for subjects.
In the future I plan on adding some of my transcribed notes, you may notice that the written language is Portuguese as that is my native tongue and the language required for the documents.
I cannot assure you that future documents won't be in that language.
